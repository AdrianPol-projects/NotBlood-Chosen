// Connection to an online relay server (server/relay.py), run on a background thread.

// Online games keep using ENet exactly like LAN games; only the UDP datagrams travel through
// one WebSocket per player:
//   joining player: ENet client -> 127.0.0.1:<relayClientPort()> -> relay -> host
//   host:           relay -> one local UDP socket per remote player -> ENet server port
// So the game's network code doesn't know the difference, and a host can even mix LAN and
// online players.
//
// Text messages (lobby commands, stats) are tab separated, see relay.py.
